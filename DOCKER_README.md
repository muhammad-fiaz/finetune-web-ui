# Docker Setup for Finetune Web UI

This guide provides instructions for building and running the **Finetune Web UI** project using Docker. The project enables a user-friendly interface for training and deploying machine learning models, specifically designed for fine-tuning pre-trained models such as Llama, GPT, etc.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Docker**: Install Docker from [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- **Docker Compose** (optional): Useful if you want to run multi-container setups.

## Dockerfiles

The project includes two Dockerfiles for building Docker images based on different dependency management systems:

- **`pip.Dockerfile`**: Dockerfile for pip-based dependency management (using `requirements.txt`).
- **`uv.Dockerfile`**: Dockerfile for Poetry-based dependency management (using `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`).

You can choose the appropriate Dockerfile depending on your preference for managing dependencies.

## Building Docker Images

### 1. **For pip-based Project**:

If you're using **pip** and have a `requirements.txt` file, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Docker image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t finetune-web-ui-pip -f pip.Dockerfile .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 7860:7860 finetune-web-ui-pip
   ```

This will start the **Finetune Web UI** and expose it on port `7860` by default.

### 2. **For UV-based Project**:

If you're using **uv** for dependency management, and have `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Docker image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t finetune-web-ui-poetry -f uv.Dockerfile .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 7860:7860 finetune-web-ui-UV
   ```

This will also start the **Finetune Web UI** and expose it on port `7860`.

### 3. **With Docker Compose** (Optional):

If you'd like to use Docker Compose for managing the application, you can create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the root of the project. Here’s an example:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
   finetune-web-ui:
      build:
         context: .
         dockerfile: uv.Dockerfile  # Change this to 'pip.Dockerfile' for pip-based setup
      ports:
         - "7860:7860"
      volumes:
         - .:/app
      environment:
         - ENV=production
```

To build and run the container with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will automatically build the Docker image and start the container.

## `.dockerignore`

Both Dockerfiles use a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from being copied into the Docker image. Here’s an example `.dockerignore` file:

```plaintext
__pycache__
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.git
*.gitignore
```

This ensures that only the relevant files are included in the Docker image, reducing its size.

## Running the Application

Once the Docker container is running, the **Finetune Web UI** should be accessible at:

```
http://localhost:7860
```

You can upload datasets, fine-tune models, and monitor training progress through the web interface.

## Project Structure

Here’s a summary of the project structure:

```bash
